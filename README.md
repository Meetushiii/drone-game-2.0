My project is a 3D obstacle game. Originally, I had this big idea of making a drone game, but since I’m still a beginner in game development, I decided to start with something I could actually finish while still keeping it exciting. So I shifted my plan to a 3D obstacle challenge. In the game, you move through a 3D world full of tricky paths, platforms, and things you have to dodge or jump over. It’s meant to be simple but fun, and it gave me the freedom to experiment with how a player moves and interacts in a 3D space.
I made this project because I’ve honestly been wanting to build games for a long time. I’ve always loved the idea of creating a world that people can explore and interact with, and I think making games is one of the most creative things you can do—it mixes art, logic, and storytelling all in one. When I saw the opportunity to work on something for Athena, it felt like my sign to finally stop just thinking about making a game and actually do it. Even though it wasn’t the original drone game I imagined, I’m really glad I made something that works and is fun to play.
I built the game in Godot, which was my first time really getting hands-on with the engine. I started by creating a basic 3D scene, then I worked on adding player movement, camera control, and obstacles. I kept tweaking things to make the movement feel smooth and the game more challenging. The hardest part by far was exporting the file to Techie—there were no mirrors available, and downloading the export templates was so much harder than I thought it would be. I had to troubleshoot a lot, read through forums, and basically figure out things on my own until it finally worked.
Through this whole process, I learned way more than I expected—not just about Godot, but also about staying patient and solving problems without giving up. I also think this project really helped me grow my creative skills, because I had to come up with my own level designs and find ways to make the game interesting without overcomplicating it. In the end, even with all the struggles, I had soooo much fun making this. It’s made me even more excited to keep building games, and I’m already thinking about what I want to make next.
